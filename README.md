# Gene Expression Programming (GEP) in Elixir

This is an independent implementation of the Gene Expression Programming (GEP)
machine learning algorithm created by Dr. CÃ¢ndida Ferreira.
It was written in the Elixir programming language by Glenn Lewis (https://keybase.io/gmlewis).

Here is a concise summary of GEP:

## Status - Work-in-progress

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

* Learn Elixir, GEP, and machine learning using GEP
* Solve all the [OpenAI Gym][] machine learning challenges in Elixir
* Compare results with Go and Dart versions

## Why Elixir?

There are a number of reasons for using [Elixir][]:

* Elixir is built on the incredible [Beam VM][],
* Elixir is a powerful functional programming language,
* Elixir has lightweight concurrent processes and can easily handle
  hundreds of thousands on a single core CPU,
* Elixir was designed to build distributed, fault-tolerant systems
  with support for massive parallel computation out of the box
  using the decades-old OTP framework established by Erlang,
* Elixir has pattern matching and powerful compile-time macros (think
  Lisp but much easier to read, write and understand due to the
  separation of semantics and syntax),
* Elixir is a dynamically-typed language thus enabling generics yet
  has the optional ability to use typespecs for added type safety,
* Elixir has a world-class REPL and hot code reloading which
  dramatically increases coder productivity due to quick experiments
  with live systems and data, and
* Elixir makes programming fun again.
